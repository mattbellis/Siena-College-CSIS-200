* Double click on the file to open. 
* **If it does not open properly or it says something about it being a Text File* then you will need to rename the file**
    * To rename the file, double click on the file name in the upper right. 
    * If it has a *.txt* at the end of the name, remove this but make sure you keep the *.ipynb*. 
    * Close the file. 
    * Reopen it. It should render properly now.
